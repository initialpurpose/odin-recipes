# odin-recipes

This project is the first project that I have completed on The Odin
Project's Foundations course. I have thoroughly enjoyed completing
the first few lessons and am excited to see how the rest of the course
plays out! Here's to the future, and the beginnings of learning full-stack
software development.

This website contains three different recipes of different types of
pasta, including Pasta alla Vodka, Pesto Pasta, and Spaghetti Aglio e
Olio. It includes images and a step-by-step guide of how to make each
recipe, including an image of each of the recipes.

I followed proper HTML semantics to the best of my ability, including
implementing accessibility features such as alt text for images.

## Skills showcased
* Foundational HTML knowledge including how to setup a HTML boilerplate
* Using bolded and italicised text
* Implementing images and links between pages
* Implementing proper folder structure
