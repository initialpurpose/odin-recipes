  <p><em>Recipe from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-dkZWSPMZ0&t=548s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Andy Cooks</a>, November 2025</em></p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>500g fusilli pasta</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic</li>
    <li>120ml olive oil</li>
    <li>30g toasted pine nuts</li>
    <li>1 bunch basil leaves, picked and washed</li>
    <li>20g Parmesan, grated</li>
    <li>sea salt to taste</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Place a large pot of salted water on to boil to cook the pasta. Cook pasta according to packet directions, until al dente. Check on your pasta now and then and give it a mix to ensure it doesn’t stick together.</li>
    <li>In a mortar and pestle, pound the garlic with a little bit of salt until it forms a paste. Then add the toasted pine nuts and start to break those down until it’s a dry paste consistency (like peanut butter).</li>
    <li>Add the parmesan and a little of the oil, and continue to work to a paste.</li>
    <li>Add the basil leaves gradually (about two pinches at a time) and pound until broken down, then add more. Keep working it until you have a coarse paste.</li>
    <li>Add the remaining oil and continue pounding until it comes together, ensuring the pesto retains some texture. Add a pinch of salt.</li>
    <li>Take ½ cup of pasta water out of the pot. Then, drain the pasta and return it to the pot. Add the pesto and a little bit of the pasta water and toss to combine, until pasta is well coated.</li>
    <li>Serve pasta with extra grated parmesan and a drizzle of olive oil.</li>
  </ol>
