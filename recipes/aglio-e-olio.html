  <p><em>Recipe from <a href="https://www.vincenzosplate.com/spaghetti-aglio-e-olio-recipe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Vincenzo's Plate</a>, April 2025</em></p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>300g spaghetti</li>
    <li>4 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
    <li>2 chillis, chopped</li>
    <li>fresh parsley, a small bunch, chopped</li>
    <li>5 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Start by finely chopping chili and parsley into small pieces.</li>
    <li>Add a tablespoon of sea salt to a large pot of boiling water and toss in the spaghetti. Cook for 12 to 13 minutes, or 1-2 min less than the packet instructions considering you will finish it off in the pan smothered in the oil sauce.</li>
    <li>Give the spaghetti a good stir 2 to 3 times while cooking to make sure it doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pan.</li>
    <li>While the pasta is cooking, make your sauce. Start by drizzling a generous amount of EVOO in a large pan over medium heat and add 2 tablespoons of water before adding the garlic.</li>
    <li>Add garlic to the pan, followed by red chili, and give everything a good stir. Add some parsley and let the sauce cook on a gentle heat, ensuring not to burn the garlic. You want the garlic to be nicely golden in color.</li>
    <li>Once the sauce smells nice, oozing with a garlicky aroma, it’s a sign that it’s almost ready to meld with spaghetti. Collect a mug of pasta water and add a little bit to the pan.</li>
    <li>Give the pan a good toss and stir to meld the flavors of olive oil, garlic, parsley, chili, parsley, and pasta water together, creating a creamy emulsion without any cream (of course!). Beat the sauce with a fork or mix using a wooden spoon – whatever it takes to mix everything and create a thicker sauce.</li>
    <li>Strain the pasta, and add it to the sauce. Gently stirring it to coat every strand of spaghetti with the unbeatable flavors</li>
    <li>Cook for an extra minute to build a creamy emulsion and let the pasta combine with all the ingredients. Pour in more pasta water adrizzle of EVOO and some parsley.</li>
    <li>Use the tongs and quickly toss the pasta with the creamy sauce sitting at the bottom so that the starch in the pasta water helps to combine all the ingredients with the pasta.</li>
    <li>Finish with a final touch of pasta water, EVOO, and parsley to seal it to perfection. Sprinkle in some toasted breadcrumbs or grated pecorino cheese (or both!) or keep things simple by adding black pepper for an added kick.</li>
    <li>Finally, plate the pasta by adding a generous portion of spaghetti to a dish, and don’t forget to collect the sauce from the bottom along with other ingredients using a spoon.</li>
    <li>Finish it off with a touch of parsley, and it’s time to dig into the best <strong>SPAGHETTI AGLIO e OLIO.</strong></li>
